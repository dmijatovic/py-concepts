# Python programming concepts

This repo is used to illustrate some general programming concepts and how to implement them in Python. The idea is to practice Python and these concepts at the same time.

Specific thema's are saved in separate folders. Each folder has README file which provides more info about the concept and the implementation.

In the challenges folder I included some challenges from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) website I found interessting.

If you want to test this approached online you can use online [repl.it](https://repl.it/repls/folder/python)

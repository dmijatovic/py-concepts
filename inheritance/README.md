# Inheritance

The inheritance approach is trademark of class used approach and object oriented programming (OOP). The idea is to create `modules` having properties (attributes) and functions (methods) in an object. So the object is self-containing and should be able to operate on its own.

The inheritance model adds to this approach by enabling classes to inherit methods and properties from other classes. Doing this the greater working machine is created build from the classes that perform specific parts. The main drive behind inheritance is DRY (do-not-repeat) principle.

Personally, I find that creating solid inheritance model is not easy. I think that functional approach (composition) is more flexible and therefore easier to use in most situations.
